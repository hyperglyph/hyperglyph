encoding:
	see encoding.rst
	add data-url/mime blobs

exceptions:
	mapping exceptions inside the mapper to error codes
	throwing an exception returns that error code
	with an 'error' type (similar to 'resource')

caching
	caching headers added to responses
	@cache(max_age=....)
	change url schema to avoid ?

	expires information in resource/embed
	Glyph.refresh?

forms/links
	type args? default values? schema
	i expect a thing with these values

	url templates for forms with GET method

classes/resources
	use a different encoding for them?
	rather than possible subelements, they have a url
	children is a dict?
	remove all instance vars from dict?
	have to expose it through @embed?

pagination


http semantics:
	support HEAD

html serialization
	javascript
	json for query args perhaps?
	 or form values
	
	

rewrite for python:
	class mapper only needs root element, rest are ephemeral?
ports
	node.js
	erlang
	jquery plugin?


different transports
	udp, openpgm, 0mq?

	coap over datagram, http over streams
